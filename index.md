## Welcome to my GitHub Page

My name is Mauricio and I'm an electrical engineer that loves **coding**, **data science**, and **sustainable energy**. This is my personal repository where you can find several code examples. I hope my work can help you to find some answers to your problems. I have organized the code in the Following categories:

* Statistics
* Data Mining
* Data Visualization
* Energy Modeling

Contact me if you have any suggeston or if you need some help with your own projects and please contribute to improve these examples.
